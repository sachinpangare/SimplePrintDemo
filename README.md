Android-Label-Bluetooth & USB-Print

Description
This app demonstrates how you can print from an Android device to portable Bluetooth & USB thermal Label printers. 

This app works with all TSPL/ZPL commands friendly printers.
We have tested the app on STech/XPrinter XP-410B, Woosim, Sewoo, Baby and Rongta printers.
Based on the implementation, the app should support almost all Bluetooth & USB printers.

For other languages, based on the font installed on the device, you need to implement your owner character mapper (Similar to the WCharMapperCT42 class).
The printing library here is used in Kasabeh Pocket Accounting Software for printing invoices and person's transactions (Kasabeh means businessmen in Farsi). See this Gist: the application of the library package in a real project.
